    "Description":"DARPA has created the Mining and Understanding Software Enclaves (MUSE) program. MUSE seeks to make significant advances in the way software is built, debugged, verified, maintained and understood. Central to its approach is the creation of a community infrastructure built around a large, diverse and evolving corpus of software drawn from the hundreds of billions of lines of open source code available today.",
